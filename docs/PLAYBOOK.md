# OpenWork Local Agent Playbook

Practical guide to run OpenWork with a local model (Ollama), work safely, and get strong day-to-day results.

## 1. What You Have

- A CLI agent loop that can read/write files, run terminal commands, and help with coding workflows.
- A local provider profile system (`profile:init` and `dev:profile`).
- Runtime checks (`doctor:runtime`) and reporting (`doctor:report`).
- A local model profile currently set to `llama3.1:8b`.

## 2. Daily Start (Fast Path)

Run this in your project root:

```bash
bun run dev:profile
```

For quick switches:

```bash
# low latency preset
bun run dev:fast

# better coding quality preset
bun run dev:code
```

If everything is healthy, OpenWork starts directly.

## 3. One-Time Setup (If Needed)

### 3.1 Initialize a local profile

```bash
bun run profile:init -- --provider ollama --model llama3.1:8b
```

### 3.2 Confirm profile file

```bash
cat .openwork-profile.json
```

### 3.3 Validate environment

```bash
bun run doctor:runtime
```

## 4. Health and Diagnostics

### 4.1 Human-readable checks

```bash
bun run doctor:runtime
```

### 4.2 JSON diagnostics (automation/logging)

```bash
bun run doctor:runtime:json
```

### 4.3 Persist runtime report

```bash
bun run doctor:report
```

Report output: `reports/doctor-runtime.json`

### 4.4 Hardening checks

```bash
# practical checks (smoke + runtime doctor)
bun run hardening:check

# strict checks (includes typecheck)
bun run hardening:strict
```

## 5. Provider Modes

### 5.1 Local mode (Ollama)

```bash
bun run profile:init -- --provider ollama --model llama3.1:8b
bun run dev:profile
```

Expected behavior:
- No API key required.
- `OPENAI_BASE_URL` should be `http://localhost:11434/v1`.

### 5.2 OpenAI mode

```bash
bun run profile:init -- --provider openai --api-key sk-... --model gpt-4o
bun run dev:profile
```

Expected behavior:
- Real API key required.
- Placeholder values fail fast.

## 6. Troubleshooting Matrix

### 6.1 `Script not found "dev"`

Cause: Running command in the wrong folder.

Fix:
```bash
cd /path/to/openwork
bun run dev:profile
```

### 6.2 `ollama: command not found`

Cause: Ollama not installed or not in PATH.

Fix: Install from https://ollama.com/download, then:
```bash
ollama --version
```

### 6.3 `Provider reachability failed` for localhost

Cause: Ollama service not running.

Fix:
```bash
ollama serve
```

Then in another terminal:
```bash
bun run doctor:runtime
```

### 6.4 `Missing key for non-local provider URL`

Cause: `OPENAI_BASE_URL` points to a remote endpoint without a key.

Fix: Re-initialize profile for ollama:
```bash
bun run profile:init -- --provider ollama --model llama3.1:8b
```

### 6.5 Placeholder key error

Cause: Placeholder was used instead of real key.

Fix:
- For OpenAI: use a real key.
- For Ollama: no key needed; keep localhost base URL.

## 7. Recommended Local Models

- Fast/general: `llama3.1:8b`
- Better coding quality (if hardware supports): `qwen2.5-coder:14b`
- Low-resource fallback: smaller instruct model

Switch model quickly:

```bash
bun run profile:init -- --provider ollama --model qwen2.5-coder:14b
bun run dev:profile
```

Preset shortcuts already configured:

```bash
bun run profile:fast   # llama3.2:3b
bun run profile:code   # qwen2.5-coder:7b
```

## 8. Practical Prompt Playbook (Copy/Paste)

### 8.1 Code understanding

- "Map this repository architecture and explain the execution flow from entrypoint to tool invocation."
- "Find the top 5 risky modules and explain why."

### 8.2 Refactoring

- "Refactor this module for clarity without behavior change, then run checks and summarize diff impact."
- "Extract shared logic from duplicated functions and add minimal tests."

### 8.3 Debugging

- "Reproduce the failure, identify root cause, implement fix, and validate with commands."
- "Trace this error path and list likely failure points with confidence levels."

### 8.4 Reliability

- "Add runtime guardrails and fail-fast messages for invalid provider env vars."
- "Create a diagnostic command that outputs JSON report for CI artifacts."

### 8.5 Review mode

- "Do a code review of unstaged changes, prioritize bugs/regressions, and suggest concrete patches."

## 9. Safe Working Rules

- Run `doctor:runtime` before debugging provider issues.
- Prefer `dev:profile` over manual env edits.
- Keep `.openwork-profile.json` local (already gitignored).
- Use `doctor:report` before asking for help so you have a reproducible snapshot.

## 10. Quick Recovery Checklist

When something breaks, run in order:

```bash
bun run doctor:runtime
bun run doctor:report
bun run smoke
```

If answers are very slow, check processor mode:

```bash
ollama ps
```

If `PROCESSOR` shows `CPU`, your setup is valid but latency will be higher for large models.

If local model mode is failing:

```bash
ollama --version
ollama serve
bun run doctor:runtime
bun run dev:profile
```

## 11. Command Reference

```bash
# profile
bun run profile:init -- --provider ollama --model llama3.1:8b
bun run profile:init -- --provider openai --api-key sk-... --model gpt-4o

# launch
bun run dev:profile
bun run dev:ollama
bun run dev:openai

# diagnostics
bun run doctor:runtime
bun run doctor:runtime:json
bun run doctor:report

# quality
bun run smoke
bun run hardening:check
bun run hardening:strict
```

## 12. Success Criteria

Your setup is healthy when:

- `bun run doctor:runtime` passes provider and reachability checks.
- `bun run dev:profile` opens the CLI normally.
- Model shown in the UI matches your selected profile model.
